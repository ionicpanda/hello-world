Hey other humans!

Justin here, I enjoy composing music.
I'm currently a double major in computer science and french horn performance.
When I'm not writing code I'm either playing my french horn or writing new music.
I'll eventually post a link to my soundcloud so you can checkout all my nifty musical tunes.
